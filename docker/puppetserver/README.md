# [puppetlabs/puppetserver](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver)

The Dockerfile for this image is available in the Puppetserver repository
[here][1].

You can run a copy of Puppet Server with the following Docker command:

    docker run --name puppet --hostname puppet puppet/puppetserver

Although it is not strictly necessary to name the container `puppet`, this is
useful when working with the other Puppet images, as they will look for a master
on that hostname by default.

If you would like to start the Puppet Server with your own Puppet code, you can
mount your own directory at `/etc/puppetlabs/code`:

    docker run --name puppet --hostname puppet -v ./code:/etc/puppetlabs/code/ puppet/puppetserver

You can find out more about Puppet Server in the [official documentation][2].

See the [pupperware repository][3] for running a full Puppet stack using Docker
Compose.

## Initialization Scripts

If you would like to do additional initialization, add a directory called `/docker-custom-entrypoint.d/` and fill it with `.sh` scripts.
These scripts will be executed at the end of the entrypoint script, before the service is ran.

## Analytics Data Collection

The puppetserver container collects usage data. This is disabled by default. You can enable it by passing `--env PUPPERWARE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true`
to your `docker run` command.

### What data is collected?
* Version of the puppetserver container.
* Anonymized IP address is used by Google Analytics for Geolocation data, but the IP address is not collected.

### Why does the puppetserver container collect data?

We collect data to help us understand how the containers are used and make decisions about upcoming changes.

### How can I opt out of puppetserver container data collection?

This is disabled by default.
